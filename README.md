<h1>Virtual Memory Simulator</h1>

This project simulates the workings of virtual memory, providing a dynamic visualization of key components such as the Table Lookaside Buffer (TLB), main memory, and page tables for each process. The CPU generates addresses randomly, and at each step of the simulation, users can observe how these components interact. Users can choose from three page replacement algorithms: Least Recently Used (LRU), First In, First Out (FIFO), and Random. To evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm, the simulation displays hit/miss rates in real time. The simulation advances one step at a time—processing a single address per step—whenever the button in the bottom right corner is clicked.
